HR Analytics: Employee Performance & Retention Analysis
📌 Objective / Problem Statement

What factors influence employee performance?

Why do employees stay or leave the organization?

Which patterns drive higher productivity and retention?

📊 Key Questions to Explore

Which departments show the highest/lowest performance?

Does tenure or age affect employee retention?

How do training/skill development impact performance?

Are employees with awards or recognitions more likely to stay?
